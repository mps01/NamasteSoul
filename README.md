## About the App
In this fast paced world where everyone just has so much workload, they forget about their mental health and they themselves don’t realise that they are stressed out. It is because of this negligence that we plan to make an app. The targets we want to achieve is that the app must be a multidisciplinary app which will allow users to keep a track of their mental health and in turn help us to create a mentally fit society.  Being locked up in their homes due to COVID-19 pandemic , many people have become stressed due to a variety of reasons.  This was the main thing which inspired us to come up with this app by the name of<b><i> Namaste Soul (Meaning “Hello Soul”) .</i></b>  

## Features of the App

The features include :
<ul>
  <li><b>Stress Predictor : </b></li> It helps us to determine the stress levels on the basis of the Facial Photo of the User .
  <li><b>Yoga Pose Checker: </b></li> It helps the user to check whether the Yoga Pose they are doing is correct or not .
  <li><b>Peaceful Music :</b></li> It helps us the user to rejuvenate our mind by listening to some peaceful music .
